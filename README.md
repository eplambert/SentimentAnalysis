# SentimentAnalysis

Sentiment analysis as applications in many fields including: marketing, psychology, and quality control. In this demo I use the AFINN dictionary. This word list was specifically created for Twitter, due to many of the traditional word lists failing to accurately model slang words. The AFINN word list also assigns a sentiment score to each word. By treating each sentence/tweet as a bag of words, a sentiment score can be tabulated and the overall sentiment strength determined.
